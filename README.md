# Welcome to my very first analysis

This was my first project, a stepping stone to embark on my first Analysis Project and test my knowledge and skills acquired throughout the 6 months of study in MasterSchool.

## Project Overview - Meet GloBox

GloBox is a dynamic online marketplace with a unique focus on curating high-quality, distinctive products from across the globe. They're currently engaged in an A/B test experiment aimed at enhancing their homepage, and your expertise is sought after!

## My Mission

My mission, is to leverage SQL, Spreadsheets, and Tableau to provide concrete insights.

The pivotal question is this: 
- Should GloBox roll out this new user experience to its entire user base?

## Audience

This project is designed for both technical and non-technical audiences. We value a diverse perspective to make the most informed decisions.

## Key Considerations

Here are some crucial factors to keep in mind:

Unification: All users need to be assigned to one of the A/B test groups.

User Activity: Remember that not all users make a purchase, so our analysis must account for various user behaviors.

Product Categories: Purchase activity extends to all product categories, not limited to just food and drink.

Exciting times lie ahead! Let's delve into the data and insights that will shape the future of GloBox.
